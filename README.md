**Technologies Used:** 

- Javascript
- MongoDB

**Approach:** 

We created the schema first and some test users. After that, we worked on CRUD functions and tested in on Postman. Once confirming there are no issues, we linked up and frontend and backend and updating any inputs required. Finally, we worked on the hashing of passwords and JWT token.
